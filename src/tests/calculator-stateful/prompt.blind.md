Build a stateful calculator in TypeScript with method chaining and memory functions.

The calculator should:
- Export a factory function that creates calculator instances
- Track a running total that starts at 0
- Support basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) that modify the total and enable chaining
- Provide a way to get the current result
- Include memory functions (store, recall, clear memory, add to memory) that are independent from the calculator's main value
- Throw an error for division by zero
